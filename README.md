Scalable infrastructure for running AI experiments, monitoring behaviors, detecting misuse, and providing user-friendly tools for researchers and policy experts. Built for reliability and flexibility.
# AI Research Infrastructure

This project provides scalable infrastructure to run experiments and evaluate AI systems efficiently. It includes tools for:
- Running AI experiments at scale with automatic retries on failures.
- Monitoring AI behavior to detect misuse or unexpected behavior.
- Offering an intuitive interface for non-technical users (researchers, policy experts).

## Features
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Ability to run large experiments on AI models with retry logic in case of failure.
- **Monitoring**: Track system performance, identify misuse, and ensure compliance with ethical standards.
- **User Interface**: Non-technical interface for researchers and policy experts to easily interact with the models and evaluate results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries: `flask`, `boto3`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/ai-research-infrastructure.git
